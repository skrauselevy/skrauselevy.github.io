<b>This website is under development</b>

My name is Sophia Krause-Levy and I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the <a href="https://cse.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">Computer Science & Engineering Department</a> at the <a href="https://ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">University of California San Diego (UCSD)</a>. My research focuses on finding ways to improve how we teach computer science. I seek to uncover barriers faced by different populations of students studying computing. By uncovering and remedying those barriers, I believe we can provide an environment that supports all students.

I am currently on the job market and am looking for academic positions.
