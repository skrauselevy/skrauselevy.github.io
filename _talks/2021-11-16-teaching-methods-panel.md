The UC San Diego CSE Department has a 
<a href="https://catalog.ucsd.edu/courses/CSE.html#cse599" target="_blank">Teaching Methods in Computer Science (CSE 599)</a> course that all first-time teaching assistants are required to take. Each quarter there is a panel of more experienced teaching assistants where the panelists answer any questions the first-time TAs have. 

I have participated in this panel for multiple quarters during my time at UC San Diego.
