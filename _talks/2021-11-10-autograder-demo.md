The UC San Diego CSE Department has a 
<a href="https://catalog.ucsd.edu/courses/CSE.html#cse599" target="_blank">Teaching Methods in Computer Science (CSE 599)</a> course that all first-time teaching assistants are required to take. For multiple quarters myself and a fellow TA have presented material on how to use <a href="https://gradescope-autograders.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">Gradescope's</a> autograder features. We present a demo and do a Q&A session on the autograder.
