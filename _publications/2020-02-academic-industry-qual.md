Previous work has found that recent computer science graduates often experience difficulty transitioning into their new roles in industry due to a significant gap between their academic experiences and industry's expectations. Although multiple studies have identified the views of students and members of industry on the value of a CS degree as preparation for industry, the faculty perspective on this topic remains unclear. Understanding these views could shed light on why the academia-industry gap has persisted despite the attention. This study identified faculty views on the goals of an undergraduate education and a CS major, focusing on preparation for careers in industry. In order to identify a spectrum of faculty views, we interviewed 14 faculty from a variety of backgrounds across three institutions. A phenomenographic analysis of the transcripts reveals that many faculty believe that industry preparation is an important programmatic goal, yet they encounter significant resource obstacles to achieving that goal.
